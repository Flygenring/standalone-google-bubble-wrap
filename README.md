		<strong>Standalone Google's Bubble Wrap</strong>
		<br />
		Ever felt the need to pop some bubbles but remembered you are out of bubble wrap? Fear not, as your new obsession is here. Cloned from [Google's latest April 1st joke](https://landing.google.co.jp/ime/ooooo/) I aim to duplicate and mantain this place so people like you can relieve their stress.
